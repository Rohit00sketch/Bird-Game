# Bird-Game
This game is developed using cpp.
The game features a bird represented by ASCII art that the player can control to avoid obstacles. 
The obstacles are represented as pipes with a gap in between them. The player's objective is to make the bird "fly" by pressing the spacebar to navigate through the gaps between the pipes. The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases as the bird successfully passes through the gaps. The code also includes a simple menu with options to start the game, view instructions, or quit the game. It utilizes functions for drawing and erasing the game elements, handles user input for controlling the bird, and includes a collision detection mechanism to determine if the bird has hit a pipe. 
If a collision occurs, the game displays a "Game Over" message and allows the player to return to the main menu.
